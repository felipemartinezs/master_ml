Machine Learning algorithms
# Welcome
Welcome to Machine Learning Algorithms From Scratch. This is your guide to learning the
details of machine learning algorithms by implementing them from scratch in Python. You
will discover how to load data, evaluate models and implement a suite of top machine learning
algorithms using step-by-step tutorials and sample code.
Machine learning algorithms do have a lot of math and theory under the covers, but you
do not need to know why algorithms work to be able to implement them and apply them to
achieve real and valuable results. From an applied perspective, machine learning is a shallow
feld and a motivated developer can quickly pick it up and start making very real and impactful
contributions. This is my goal for you and this book is your ticket to that outcome.

## Implement Machine Learning Algorithms
Most developers that I know (myself included) learn best by implementing. It is our preferred
learning style and it is the reason that I created this book. This section lists the benets of
implementing machine learning algorithms from scratch, some benefits from extending your own
implementations as well as some limitations to this approach to learning.
